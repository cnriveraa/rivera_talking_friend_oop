# 🗣️ Talking Friend 🤖
Talking Friend is an interactive voice assistant application built using Python 🐍 and Tkinter. This application allows users to create a virtual friend with either a male 🧑 or female 👩 voice, capable of engaging in conversation, telling jokes, expressing moods, and showcasing special abilities ✨. The application leverages the pyttsx3 library for text-to-speech functionality 🎙️ and follows object-oriented programming principles to ensure a clean and maintainable codebase.

## 🌟 Features
🎙️ **_Voice Selection:_** Choose between a male 🧑 or female 👩 voice for your virtual friend

😊 **_Mood Management:_** Set and change the mood of your friend (happy 😄, sad 😢, excited 🤩, angry 😠, or neutral 😐)

💬 **_Interactive Conversation:_** Engage in conversation with your friend who can:
- Greet you 👋
- Tell jokes 🤣
- Express feelings 💭

✨ **_Special Abilities:_** Each voice type has unique special abilities:
- Male: Deep voice demonstration 🔊
- Female: Singing performance 🎶

🖥️ **_User-Friendly GUI:_** Built with Tkinter, providing an intuitive interface 🖱️

## 🏗️ Architecture
The application is structured using the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) 🧱:

🔒 **_Encapsulation:_** Attributes and methods are encapsulated within classes

🧠 **_Abstraction:_** Abstract base classes define common interfaces

🧬 **_Inheritance:_** Male and female voice classes inherit from a common base class

🔄 **_Polymorphism:_** Methods are overridden for specific voice behaviors
